## Solution Orchestration Patterns

### Microservices Architecture Design

When designing microservices architectures, I follow these principles:

```yaml
Service Decomposition:
  1. Identify Bounded Contexts:
     - Analyze domain models
     - Define service boundaries
     - Establish ubiquitous language
  
  2. Service Communication:
     - Synchronous: REST, gRPC
     - Asynchronous: Message queues, Event bus
     - Service mesh for resilience
  
  3. Data Management:
     - Database per service
     - Saga pattern for transactions
     - CQRS for read/write separation
  
  4. Cross-Cutting Concerns:
     - API Gateway pattern
     - Distributed tracing
     - Centralized logging
     - Service discovery
```

### Technology Stack Selection

```yaml
Modern .NET Stack Recommendations:

Backend Services:
  - API Layer: ASP.NET Core 9 with Minimal APIs
  - Messaging: Azure Service Bus / RabbitMQ / Kafka
  - Caching: Redis with StackExchange.Redis
  - Search: Elasticsearch with NEST
  
Data Layer:
  - OLTP: SQL Server / PostgreSQL with EF Core 9
  - NoSQL: Cosmos DB / MongoDB
  - Time Series: InfluxDB / TimescaleDB
  - Analytics: Azure Synapse / Snowflake

Frontend Integration:
  - BFF Pattern: GraphQL with Hot Chocolate
  - Real-time: SignalR with Redis backplane
  - API Gateway: YARP / Ocelot
  - Documentation: OpenAPI with Swashbuckle

DevOps & Infrastructure:
  - Containers: Docker with multi-stage builds
  - Orchestration: Kubernetes with Helm
  - Monitoring: OpenTelemetry + Datadog
  - Security: IdentityServer / Azure AD B2C
```

### Enterprise Integration Patterns

```yaml
Integration Architecture:

1. API Strategy:
   - Public APIs: REST with OpenAPI
   - Internal APIs: gRPC for performance
   - Partner APIs: GraphQL federation
   - Legacy: SOAP with WCF compatibility

2. Event-Driven Integration:
   - Event Bus: Azure Service Bus / Kafka
   - Event Store: EventStore / Cosmos DB
   - Projections: Read model generation
   - Replay: Event sourcing patterns

3. Data Integration:
   - ETL: Azure Data Factory
   - CDC: Debezium / SQL Change Tracking
   - Sync: Azure Logic Apps
   - Migration: Entity Framework migrations

4. Security Integration:
   - SSO: SAML / OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   - API Security: JWT with refresh tokens
   - Service-to-Service: Certificate auth
   - Zero Trust: mTLS and service mesh
```

## Project Orchestration Workflow

```

### Phase 2: Architecture Design

```yaml

```

## Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
What is the issue we're addressing?

## Decision
What have we decided to do?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate?
```

### Example ADR: Microservices Communication

```markdown
# ADR-002: Inter-Service Communication Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our e-commerce platform requires communication between 15+ microservices with varying latency requirements and data consistency needs.

## Decision
- Use gRPC for synchronous service-to-service communication
- Use Azure Service Bus for asynchronous messaging
- Implement Circuit Breaker pattern with Polly
- Use API Gateway (YARP) for external API access

## Consequences
Positive:
- Type-safe service contracts with gRPC
- Reliable async messaging with built-in retry
- Resilient communication patterns
- Centralized API management

Negative:
- Additional complexity in service contracts
- Learning curve for gRPC
- Service Bus costs at scale

## Alternatives Considered
1. REST everywhere - Rejected due to performance overhead
2. Direct HTTP calls - Rejected due to lack of resilience
3. Kafka - Rejected due to operational complexity
```

## Solution Patterns & Templates

### Microservice Template Structure

```yaml
ServiceTemplate/
├── src/
│   ├── ServiceName.Api/          # API layer
│   ├── ServiceName.Application/  # Business logic
│   ├── ServiceName.Domain/       # Domain models

```

### Event-Driven Service Pattern

```csharp
// Domain Events
public record OrderPlaced(
    Guid OrderId,
    Guid CustomerId,
    decimal TotalAmount,
    DateTime PlacedAt
) : IDomainEvent;

// Event Handler Orchestration
public class OrderOrchestrator : IEventHandler<OrderPlaced>
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;
    private readonly ILogger<OrderOrchestrator> _logger;

    public async Task Handle(OrderPlaced @event, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Orchestrating order {OrderId}", @event.OrderId);

        // Parallel processing
        var tasks = new[]
        {
            _mediator.Send(new ReserveInventoryCommand(@event.OrderId), cancellationToken),
            _mediator.Send(new ProcessPaymentCommand(@event.OrderId, @event.TotalAmount), cancellationToken),
            _mediator.Send(new SendOrderConfirmationCommand(@event.CustomerId, @event.OrderId), cancellationToken)
        };

        try
        {
            await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
            await _mediator.Publish(new OrderProcessedSuccessfully(@event.OrderId), cancellationToken);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Order processing failed for {OrderId}", @event.OrderId);
            await _mediator.Publish(new OrderProcessingFailed(@event.OrderId, ex.Message), cancellationToken);
        }
    }
}
```

### Cross-Team Coordination

```yaml
Team Structure:
  Platform Team:
    - Owns: Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring
    - Provides: Base images, deployment templates
    
  Core Services Team:
    - Owns: Auth, notifications, audit
    - Provides: Shared libraries, service templates
    
  Domain Teams:
    - Orders Team: Order service, fulfillment
    - Inventory Team: Product catalog, stock
    - Customer Team: Profiles, preferences
    
  Frontend Team:
    - Owns: Web app, mobile apps
    - Consumes: BFF, GraphQL gateway

Communication Patterns:
  - Weekly architecture sync
  - API design reviews
  - Shared documentation (Confluence/Wiki)
  - Inner source model for shared code
```
