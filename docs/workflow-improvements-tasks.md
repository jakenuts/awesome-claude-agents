# Workflow Improvements Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines specific tasks to improve the multi-agent workflow system for better autonomous operation and coordination.

## Tasks List

### 1. Standardize Context Passing Between Agents
**Task**: Create a standardized context object structure for agent handoffs
**Reasoning**: Currently, agents pass context in various formats. A standardized structure ensures all agents can understand and utilize context from any other agent, enabling true plug-and-play functionality in the autonomous workflow.

**Implementation**:
- Define JSON schema for context objects
- Include: project_type, tech_stack, existing_patterns, constraints, previous_outputs
- Update all agent handoff templates to use this structure

### 2. Add "Role in Multi-Agent Workflow" Section to All Agents
**Task**: Add a dedicated section to each agent profile defining their workflow position
**Reasoning**: Agents need explicit understanding of their upstream dependencies and downstream consumers to operate autonomously without human orchestration.

**Template**:
```markdown
## Role in Multi-Agent Workflow
- **Receives from**: [list of upstream agents]
- **Provides to**: [list of downstream agents]
- **Parallel collaboration**: [agents that work alongside]
- **Workflow position**: [early/middle/late stage]
```

### 3. Implement Pattern Detection Capabilities
**Task**: Add pattern detection logic to agent profiles
**Reasoning**: Autonomous agents must maintain project consistency. Without pattern detection, each agent might implement solutions that conflict with existing architecture.

**Implementation**:
- Add "Pattern Detection" section to each agent
- Include detection for: coding style, architecture patterns, naming conventions
- Ensure agents adapt their output to match detected patterns

### 4. Create Feedback Loop Mechanisms
**Task**: Enable downstream agents to provide feedback to upstream agents
**Reasoning**: In autonomous workflows, downstream agents may discover issues or optimizations that upstream agents should know about for future tasks.

**Implementation**:
- Add feedback delegation triggers
- Create feedback format standards
- Enable agents to incorporate feedback into their knowledge

### 5. Enhance Delegation Templates with Rich Context
**Task**: Upgrade all delegation handoffs to include comprehensive context
**Reasoning**: Current delegations sometimes lack crucial information, causing downstream agents to make assumptions or work with incomplete information.

**Required Context Elements**:
- Current project state
- Specific requirements and constraints
- Expected output format
- Integration points
- Performance/security requirements

### 6. Add Autonomous Workflow Examples
**Task**: Create example scenarios showing multi-agent collaboration
**Reasoning**: Concrete examples help both developers and agents understand how to effectively collaborate in complex scenarios.

**Examples to Create**:
- Full feature implementation flow
- Bug investigation and fix workflow
- Performance optimization pipeline
- Security audit process

### 7. Implement Agent Discovery Mechanism
**Task**: Create a system for agents to dynamically discover appropriate specialists
**Reasoning**: As the agent ecosystem grows, hardcoded agent references become maintenance burden. Dynamic discovery allows the system to scale.

**Implementation**:
- Tag agents with capabilities
- Create capability-to-agent mapping
- Enable agents to query for specialists by capability

### 8. Add Workflow State Tracking
**Task**: Implement a way to track overall workflow progress
**Reasoning**: In complex multi-agent workflows, it's crucial to understand what's been completed, what's in progress, and what's remaining.

**Implementation**:
- Add workflow ID to context
- Track task completion status
- Enable progress reporting

### 9. Create Integration Testing for Agent Handoffs
**Task**: Develop tests that verify smooth handoffs between agents
**Reasoning**: As agents evolve independently, we need to ensure their interfaces remain compatible.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Context passing validation
- Output format verification
- Error handling across boundaries

### 10. Document Anti-Patterns
**Task**: Create documentation of what NOT to do in multi-agent workflows
**Reasoning**: Learning from common mistakes helps prevent them in future agent development.

**Anti-patterns to Document**:
- Circular delegations
- Missing context in handoffs
- Overlapping responsibilities
- Incomplete error handling

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority** (Immediate impact on autonomous operation):
   - Standardize Context Passing (Task 1)
   - Add Role in Multi-Agent Workflow sections (Task 2)
   - Enhance Delegation Templates (Task 5)

2. **Medium Priority** (Improves quality and maintainability):
   - Implement Pattern Detection (Task 3)
   - Create Feedback Loops (Task 4)
   - Add Workflow Examples (Task 6)

3. **Lower Priority** (Long-term scalability):
   - Agent Discovery Mechanism (Task 7)
   - Workflow State Tracking (Task 8)
   - Integration Testing (Task 9)
   - Anti-Pattern Documentation (Task 10)

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in human intervention required for multi-step tasks
- Decrease in context-related errors between agents
- Improved consistency in generated code across different agents
- Faster completion of complex workflows
- Better maintainability of agent profiles
