# Proposed New Agent Profiles

## Overview
These agent profiles fill clear gaps in the current ecosystem and do not overlap with existing agents.

## 1. QA Automation Coordinator

**Rationale**: No existing QA/testing coordination agent. While individual agents may write tests, there's no specialist for comprehensive test strategy and coordination.

**Unique Value**:
- Orchestrates testing across all layers (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
- Ensures test coverage meets requirements
- Coordinates with different framework-specific testing approaches
- Manages test data and environments

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike code-reviewer who reviews existing code, this agent proactively plans and implements comprehensive testing strategies.

## 2. DevOps Pipeline Architect

**Rationale**: No existing CI/CD or deployment automation specialist. This is a critical gap for production-ready applications.

**Unique Value**:
- Designs and implements CI/CD pipelines
- Creates containerization strategies
- Implements infrastructure as code
- Manages deployment configurations
- Sets up monitoring and alerting

**Key Differentiator**: Focuses on the deployment and operational aspects that no current agent addresses.

## 3. Observability Engineer

**Rationale**: No existing monitoring or observability specialist. Modern applications require comprehensive observability.

**Unique Value**:
- Implements structured logging strategies
- Sets up metrics collection and dashboards
- Configures distributed tracing
- Creates alerting rules and runbooks
- Establishes SLIs/SLOs

**Key Differentiator**: Specialized in making systems observable and debuggable in production, which no current agent handles.

## 4. API Documentation Specialist

**Rationale**: While api-architect designs APIs, there's no specialist for creating comprehensive, developer-friendly documentation.

**Unique Value**:
- Generates OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Creates interactive API documentation
- Writes authentication guides
- Provides code examples in multiple languages
- Documents webhooks and events

**Key Differentiator**: Focuses purely on documentation and developer experience, complementing but not overlapping with api-architect.

## 5. Integration Test Architect

**Rationale**: While we have backend and frontend specialists, there's no agent focused on integration points and contract testing.

**Unique Value**:
- Designs integration test strategies
- Implements contract testing
- Creates API mocking strategies
- Tests third-party integrations
- Validates data flows between services

**Key Differentiator**: Specializes in the boundaries between systems, which is often where bugs occur.

## Non-Recommended Agents (Due to Overlap)

### Product Technical Manager
**Overlap**: The tech-lead-orchestrator already handles technical coordination and requirement breakdown. Adding another coordination layer would create confusion about responsibilities.

### Security Specialist
**Overlap**: The code-reviewer already includes security review capabilities. A separate security agent might be redundant unless it offers significantly different capabilities (like penetration testing).

## Implementation Priority

1. **DevOps Pipeline Architect** - Critical for any production deployment
2. **QA Automation Coordinator** - Essential for quality assurance
3. **Observability Engineer** - Necessary for production operations
4. **API Documentation Specialist** - Important for developer experience
5. **Integration Test Architect** - Valuable for complex systems

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed agent profiles for the approved new agents
2. Define their delegation patterns and handoff templates
3. Establish their position in the multi-agent workflow
4. Create example scenarios showing their integration with existing agents
